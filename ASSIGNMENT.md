# Premise

To raise money for your class trip, your organization is hosting a Battle Royale Game Tournament. It's $20 to play, and the last player standing takes home a $200 cash prize. There's just one small problem: the online registration website crashed and not everybody has registered yet. Breaking this problem down into more manageable steps, you realize that 50 people have already pre-registered. So you just need to find out who is registered and who is not.

Searching for additional information, you realize the pre-registration list is on a CSV file. You can use Python to search the file for pre-registered guests. If they are not pre-registered, you'll need a way to add them to the list. Afterwards, you'll need to provide a printed list of all registered players to the tournament judges.

# Assignment

Bare minimum:

 - Write pseudocode including any necessary input, calculations, and output
 - Access the data by importing the "battle_royale.csv" file. (This file has already been saved for you to use in the course IDLE.)
 - Create a menu with three options:
    - Search if a pre-registered player appears in the list or not
    - Find the number of a specific player
    - Print a list of players and their information
 - Use at least one if-else or elif statement
